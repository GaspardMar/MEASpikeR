\usage{
spike_detection_rate(
  object = NA,
  filt.data.path = NA,
  working_directory = NA,
  spike_col = "forestgreen",
  plot = "line"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class MEASpikeR generated by the \code{dataset_filtering} function}

\item{filt.data.path}{Path to the ".Rdat" file generated by the \code{dataset_filtering} function}

\item{working_directory}{Character specifying the working directory where we want to save the output excel file}

\item{spike_col}{Character specifying the color for the spikes with no spike sorting (by default "forestgreen")}

\item{plot}{Character specifying the type of plot ("needle" or "line") (by default "line")}
}
\value{
An excel file calles "AWSDR" with date and time as prefix is created with as many sheets as there are conditions,
where each sheet contains a table with two columns.
The first column indicates time, and the second column indicates the firing rate.
Additionally, there is a graphic per condition representing the firing rate (Hz) as a function of time (s).
All these files are saved in the working directory specified in the 'working_directory' argument.
