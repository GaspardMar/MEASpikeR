Description: The MEASpikeR is a library of R functions designed for spike analysis.
    The functions in MEASpikeR can be classified into three main blocks 
    (i) dataset filtering; (ii) exploratory data analyses and (iii) data visualization.
    Its power resides in the use of an analytical guideline to perform customized 
    and multiple analysis of a single recording file.
